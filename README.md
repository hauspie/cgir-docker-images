This repository is a collection of docker image that I use for
teaching network services configuration at Université Lille 1.

You can run these images using:

    $ docker run -d hauspie/cgir-imagename

where `imagename` is the name of the folder of the Dockerfile. These
images are automatically build on dockerhub
